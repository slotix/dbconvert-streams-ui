# CLAUDE.md

**IMPORTANT**: Before answering any question about this project, you MUST read the file `.ai/instructions.md` which contains all project guidelines, architecture, conventions, and rules. That file is the single source of truth shared across all AI assistants.

This file contains Claude Code-specific settings only.

## Claude-Specific Rules

- **Never** start or run `yarn dev` — the maintainer does this manually.
- Make minimal, atomic commits with clear messages.
- Ensure `yarn lint` and `yarn test:unit` pass before suggesting a PR.
- Do not modify backend references or credentials.
- Use `lucide-vue-next` only.
- Follow `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (Section 6) whenever adjusting colors or adding new visual elements.
