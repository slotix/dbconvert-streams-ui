# Gemini Code Understanding

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the DBConvert Streams UI project, generated by Gemini to assist with future development and maintenance.

## Project Overview

The project is a Vue.js single-page application (SPA) that serves as the frontend for "DBConvert Streams," a data migration and real-time replication platform. It's built with TypeScript, Vite, Pinia for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application communicates with a backend API to manage database connections, data streams, and monitoring. It also integrates with Sentry for error tracking.

### Key Technologies

*   **Framework:** Vue.js 3
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **State Management:** Pinia
*   **Routing:** Vue Router
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Testing:**
    *   Unit: Vitest
    *   End-to-End: Playwright
*   **Linting:** ESLint
*   **Formatting:** Prettier
*   **API Communication:** Axios

### Architecture

The application follows a standard Vue.js project structure:

*   `src/main.ts`: The application entry point.
*   `src/App.vue`: The root Vue component.
*   `src/router/index.ts`: Defines the application's routes.
*   `src/stores`: Contains the Pinia state management stores.
*   `src/views`: Contains the top-level view components for each route.
*   `src/components`: Contains reusable UI components.
*   `src/api`: Contains the API client and related services.
*   `src/assets`: Contains static assets like CSS and images.
*   `tests`: Contains end-to-end tests.
*   `src/__tests__`: Contains unit tests.

## Building and Running

The following commands are available in `package.json` to build, run, and test the application:

*   **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
*   **`npm run build`**: Builds the application for production.
*   **`npm run preview`**: Previews the production build locally.
*   **`npm run start`**: Starts the production preview on a specific port.
*   **`npm run test`**: Runs the end-to-end tests using Playwright.
*   **`npm run test:unit`**: Runs the unit tests using Vitest.
*   **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
*   **`npm run format`**: Formats the code using Prettier.

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The project uses Prettier for automatic code formatting and ESLint to enforce code quality. The configuration for these tools can be found in `.prettierrc.json` and `eslint.config.js`, respectively.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS is the primary styling solution. Customizations to the default theme are in `tailwind.config.mjs`.
*   **State Management:** Pinia is used for centralized state management. Each major feature (e.g., connections, streams) has its own store in the `src/stores` directory.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Unit tests are written with Vitest and are located in the `src/__tests__` directory.
    *   End-to-end tests are written with Playwright and are located in the `tests` directory.
*   **API Communication:** All communication with the backend API is handled through the `axios` client configured in `src/api/apiClient.ts`.
